# RobotColor

robotColor takes an html element and creates an array of randomly generated, alternating color blocks for each letter.

The current version of the script is modularized as a requireJS module.

The basic usage takes an HTML element like:

```html
<header>robotColor</header>
```

The javascript side looks like:

```javascript
$('header').robotColor();
```
